#### Vision

##### Computer Vision

- What are Azure Computer Vision APIs?

The cloud-based Computer Vision API provides developers with access to advanced algorithms for processing images and returning information. By uploading an image or specifying an image URL, Microsoft Computer Vision algorithms can analyze visual content in different ways based on inputs and user choices.

##### Spatial Analysis

- What is Spatial Analysis Services?

Computer Vision spatial analysis is a new feature of Azure Cognitive Services Computer Vision that helps organizations maximize the value of their physical spaces by understanding people's movements and presence within a given area. It allows you to ingest video from CCTV or surveillance cameras, run AI operations to extract insights from the video streams, and generate events to be used by other systems. With input from a camera stream, an AI operation can do things like count the number of people entering a space or measure compliance with face mask and social distancing guidelines.

- What are some of the characteristics and limitations for Computer Vision Spatial Analysis?

Computer Vision spatial analysis is a building block for creating an end-to-end solution which includes other building blocks. It's not possible to provide universally applicable estimates of accuracy for the actual system you are planning to deploy.

- How accurate is spatial analysis?

System accuracy depends on a number of factors, including core model accuracy, camera placement, configuration of regions of interest, how people interact with the system, and how people interpret the system's output. The following sections are designed to help you understand key concepts about accuracy as they apply to using spatial analysis.
